A project to use machine learning to intelligently recommend anime. In testing, this project achieved an average AUC score of ~90%. For more information, see [here](MAL%20Recommendation.pdf).

## Currently Done:

* [Collect data](https://github.com/VirtualLights/MyAnimeList-Scraper)
* Create model
* Generate recommendations
* Added k-fold cross validation to calculate training and testing AUC
* Wrap code into functions
* Add methods to add additional users and lists to the model

## To Do:

* Write a better README (with installation instructions, screenshots, etc.)
* Potentially host parts of the program on a web server?
