# MAL-Recommendation

# Currently Done:

* [Collect data](https://github.com/VirtualLights/MyAnimeList-Scraper)
* Create model
* Generate recommendations
* Added k-fold cross validation to calculate training and testing AUC

# To Do:

* Write a better README (with installation instructions, screenshots, etc.)
* Wrap code into functions (sort of done?)
* Add methods to add additional users and lists to the model
* Potentially host parts of the program on a web server?
